\begin{abstract}
\textnormal{
We introduce the CS336 project, a movie theater system that will efficiently get user's queries. Using four different type of users, each having their own user rights, with entities and attributes creates this DBMS. So far The problems that have come up , we have come with a solution. There are 8 scenarios with our DBMS that our group came up with and it should work as stated.
